				<h1>Daily objectives</h1>

				<p>
					Complete them every day. Rewards are more than worth it and some of these quests are as easy as planting single tree somewhere in your city. Hint: <br><br>

			<div class="boost">
				<h1>Boost items</h1>
				<p>There are few types. Attack/defense bonus during the war, among anti-scout. Production boost items can be very useful especially later on, when resoruces production buildings are higher level. Check them out and don't forget to use them. Production boost items will help you complete the set of daily objectives.</p>

				<h1>Farming</h1>
				<p>If you see blue arrow pointing at tile, it's someone from your alliance being quicker than you this time. Simply find another tile.</p>
				<img src="farmfriend.png" alt="">
				<p>
					Check how many available troops you have before sending gatherers to tile. If you have less than it's required, find lower level one. Never EVER leave half-empty tile because <span>potato</span> tile doesn't respawn until cleared.
				</p>
				<h3>Good example:</h3>

				<h3>Bad example:</h3>
				<img src="farm5bad.png" alt="">
				<img src="setup4.png" alt=""> <br><br>
				<h3>Solution:</h3>
				<p>Manually lower amount of troops to make it equal to troops load and go to level 4 farm.</p>
				<img src="lvl4.png" alt="">
				<img src="solution.png" alt=""> <br><br>
				<p><h3>Bonus:</h3> Play with sliders, make custom setups then use them later. Figure out how green and blue arrows works. It's easy and very helpful.</p>

			<div class="rallies">
				<h1>Rallies</h1>
				<p>Use siege for gathering and include them in troops only if you see that rally is too small for it's target. Avoid sending em to rally. It's slowing things down due to terrible siege's march speed.</p>
				<p>Before calling any rally, it's good to announce it on alliance chat, to find out how many people are online and into joining you. This will help you decide how many troops you should send, depending on what type of rally you gonna make. Teamplay mindset required. Few facts:</p>
				<h2>Lohar</h2>
				<p>
					<h3>Junior Lohar</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>only 12k tier 1 troops required</li>
						<li>join rally with smaller amount of troops (let's say 10k), so more different people can participate</li>
						<li>by doing this, more people will make progress which will positively affects overal progress of alliance</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Dauntless Lohar</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>120k tier 2 troops required</li>
						<li>you are allowed to join rally with higher amount of troops but still don't forget that letting more people participate is always the best thing</li>
						<li>use alliance chat to check how many people will join you </li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>Forts</h2>
				<p>
					Rewards depends on how much damage you did during the battle. This is a good excuse for sending higher amount of troops. Still, same things could apply from Lohar case. If there is many people around, use chat, communicate, find out how many troops you should send so as many people as possible can participate.
